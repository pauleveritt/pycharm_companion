Frontend Tooling
================

The world of frontends involves many technologies: HTML, CSS, and of course,
JavaScript. In recent years, flourishing ecosystems of tools for these
technologies have sprung up, usually implemented in NodeJS.

In this section we introduce these tools, how to think of them from a
Python perspective, and how to use them in PyCharm. Each article is intended
to be standalone, serving as prerequisites to other articles and series
that teach certain technologies.
