===========================
React+TypeScript QuickStart
===========================

:ref:`technology-react` is wildly popular and thus wildly supported.
:ref:`technology-typescript` is increasingly popular, and thus increasingly
supported.

The two together? Not as much, and given that they both change quickly, its
hard to find accurate learning materials.

React+TypeScript, with PyCharm? That three-part combination is the topic
of this series. We'll show a little about a lot. Meaning, the key steps
to getting productive, in PyCharm, for React projects using TypeScript.

The material in this series provides:

- Features

    - Updated

    - Visual

        - Updated videos, with captions for the transcript

    - Gradual

        - Mostly standalone

        - Care put into not packing too much into one step

    - Supported

        - Perhaps a forum like Disqus

    - Explained

        - Written instructions for each step

        - Text with deeper explanation and links to supporting material

    - Organized (interlinking, external resources)

        - Useful search

        - Links to pre-requisite courses, to keep these courses lean-and-mean

    - Open

    - Working code

        - A repo with working code, where you can ask questions (or file
          pull requests for improvements)

    - IDE

        - Nothing requires the IDE

        - IDE productivity features sprinkled into each lesson

- Mention link to source code
