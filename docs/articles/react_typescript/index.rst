===========================
React+TypeScript QuickStart
===========================

:ref:`technology-react` is wildly popular and thus wildly supported.
:ref:`technology-typescript` is increasingly popular, and thus increasingly
supported.

The two together? Not as much, and given that they both change quickly, its
hard to find accurate learning materials.

React+TypeScript, with PyCharm? That three-part combination is the topic
of this series. We'll show a little about a lot. Meaning, the key steps
to getting productive, in PyCharm, for React projects using TypeScript.

The material in this series provides:

- Text with an explanation and links
to supporting material

- A repo with working code, where you can ask questions (or file pull
  requests for improvements)

- Updated videos, with captions for the transcript

- Mostly standalone

- Links to pre-requisite courses, to keep these courses lean-and-mean

- IDE productivity features sprinkled into each lesson

- Perhaps a forum like Disqus

- Useful search
