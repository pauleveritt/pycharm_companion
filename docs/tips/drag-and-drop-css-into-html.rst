==================================================
Drag-and-Drop CSS Into HTML and Auto-Generate Link
==================================================

Working with HTML means working with CSS and JavaScript resources. It's no
fun typing in the link and script tag references to static resources.

Let PyCharm do it for you. In PyCharm's Project file listing, select the
files you want inserted, then drag and drop them into the editor.
PyCharm will generate new markup in the head that links to the
relative path for those resources.
