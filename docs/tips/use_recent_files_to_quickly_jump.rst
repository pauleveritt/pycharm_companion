=================================
Quickly Jump Between Recent Files
=================================

Programming means a lot of back-and-forth between files. It's tempting to
use tabs and keep your "working set" open and visible. But that has downsides.

Instead, let PyCharm help you jump between files you're actively working
on. The ``Recent Files`` shortcut brings up a handy popup, including the
files you've most recently edited, in reverse order. When it appears, start
typing and PyCharm filters the list. When the file you want to jump to is
selected, hit enter.

Most of the time the file you want is the one you were just on. So it's
simple: Cmd-E (Mac) then enter.
