Flask-RESTful is an extension for Flask that adds support for quickly
building REST APIs. It is a lightweight abstraction that works with your
existing ORM/libraries. Flask-RESTful encourages best practices with minimal
setup. If you are familiar with Flask, Flask-RESTful should be easy to pick
up.

We use it in a number of our demos to quickly make a REST API.
