Make sense of your variables at a glance with semantic highlighting
===================================================================

This blog post covers:

- It's So Noisy helps make sense of the keywords in a block

- IntelliJ Got It makes it available

- Crank Up the Signal discusses tuning and preferences

- Your Colors Make Me Sad covers changing colors
