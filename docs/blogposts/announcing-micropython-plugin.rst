Announcing the MicroPython Plugin for PyCharm
=============================================

Today weâ€™ve released the MicroPython plugin 1.0 for PyCharm. This plugin
lets you edit your MicroPython code and interact with your MicroPython-powered
microcontrollers using PyCharm. It supports ESP8266, Pyboard, and BBC Micro:bit
devices. The plugin is being developed as a team project by the PyCharm
Community lead Andrey Vlasovskikh. The source code for the project can be
found on GitHub.
