=================================
Life Without the Project Explorer
=================================

It’s an indisputable (alternative) fact that, since Before the Dawn of Time™,
or at least since GUIs became in vogue, file explorers are an essential part
of any programming tool. Gotta browse them trees. It’s impossible to imagine
not having your directory browser open in something like PyCharm’s Project
Tool.

- What Was I Just Doing? (Recent Files)

- This Tab’s On Me (turn off tabs)
