=========
Scratches
=========

Sometimes you just have a snippet of code you'd like to toy with. Or some
notes from a phone call. Nothing you want to commit to saving in your project,
and certainly nothing to put in VCS.

PyCharm *scratches* provide this. You can use a scratch *buffer* (unformatted
text) or a scratch *file* (the extension dictates the language.) These are
stored apart from the sources of your project.
