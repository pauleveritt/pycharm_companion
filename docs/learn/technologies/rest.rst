REST
====

REST (*Representational State Transfer*) is a popular way of doing data on
the web, in which data are represented in a format called
`JSON <https://www.json.org/>`_. This is most useful when using JavaScript
in a browser to make dynamic web pages.

Python has rich support for REST with many packages and frameworks. PyCharm
Professional provides support for REST with its :ref:`kbbtopic-http_client`.
