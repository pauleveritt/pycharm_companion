jsdom
=====

jsdom is a pure-JavaScript implementation of many web standards, notably the
WHATWG DOM and HTML Standards, for use with Node.js. In general, the goal of
the project is to emulate enough of a subset of a web browser to be useful
for testing and scraping real-world web applications.

Its benefit: fast-performance unit testing without much hair-pulling to setup.
