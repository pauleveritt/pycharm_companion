=================
Run Configuration
=================

During development you need to run programs. Sometimes you need to run them
in different ways, with different settings.

PyCharm uses "run configurations" to define how to run something. You can
just run something and let PyCharm do the settings for you, or create/edit
a run configuration from specially-defined configuration types. These
run configurations are used not just for running, but also for debugging,
profiling, coverage, and more.
