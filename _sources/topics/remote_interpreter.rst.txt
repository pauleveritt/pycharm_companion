==================
Remote Interpreter
==================

Modern Python development involves sophisticated environments, sometimes
managed remotely over SSH or locally in systems such as
:ref:`technology-vagrant` or :ref:`technology-docker`.

PyCharm Professional supports defining remote interpreters in Vagrant, Docker,
Docker, Compose, WSL, and SSH.
