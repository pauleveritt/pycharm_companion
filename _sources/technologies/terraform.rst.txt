Terraform
=========

Terraform, an open source tool from HashiCorp, enables you to safely and
predictably create, change, and improve infrastructure. It is an open source
tool that codifies APIs into declarative configuration files that can be
shared amongst team members, treated as code, edited, reviewed, and versioned.
