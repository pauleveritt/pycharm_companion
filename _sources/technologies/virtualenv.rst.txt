==========
virtualenv
==========

Python developers are encouraged to develop their projects in isolation, so
that packages (and versions) in one project don't pollute another. Virtual
environments (or ``virtualenvs``) are Python's system for providing this
isolation.

PyCharm has very good support for working with virtualenvs.
