    PyCharm hosts webinars, usually on a monthly basis, where we cover some
    topic of interest to our Python developer audience. This usually means
    inviting an expert to present and fielding questions from the audience
    during the webinar.

    We record these and make them available on YouTube. Here is a compendium of
    our webinars.
